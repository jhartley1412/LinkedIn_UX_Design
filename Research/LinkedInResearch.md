LinkedIn Research

Competitive Analysis/Company Research
	LinkedIn seems to be most widely described as the "professional Facebook," or the "Facebook for jobs." It's a type of social media that displays your current and past employment history and, in some cases, helps recruiters and new job opportunities to find you or vice versa. In their own words, LinkedIn is there to "Connect, Find, Be found, Power your career, and Learn and share." They're all about helping you build your "professional identity," and basically get the most out of the corporate/professional/career world.
	As a website, that's essentially their main goal. They want you to sign up, fill out a profile, and connect, whether that be through actually connections with colleagues, join groups, post and answer job listings or follow people and companies. 

	Competing Companies:
		- Facebook. Although not really in the business of business (per se) Facebook is a social media app that connects people with other people, business and upcoming events, projects and movements. Basically anything you can do on Facebook can also be done on LinkedIn
			- Facebook at Work is also an upcoming possible opponent for LinkedIn. Although from what I've seen/read it looks more like possible competition for apps like Slack.
		- Twitter. Same deal as Facebook, Twitter is another social media app that lets people connect with the world around them. Although Twitter can almost be seen as a companion site to LinkedIn in certain areas of business.
		- Indeed (job hunting sites). Indeed, like LinkedIn can be, is used to help people find job listings and apply to positions online. However having an Indeed profile isn't as apparent/necessary to traverse through the site as much as it is on LinkedIn

		As it stands now, there really isn't one big competitor to LinkedIn that most people have heard of. A list of other Network driven sites: https://www.searchenginejournal.com/8-alternatives-linkedin-professional-networking-needs/71263/


Personal Notes on Profile Page / Frustrations
	- Whats the point of the "Profile Strength" section? (gamification?)
		- nothing is clickable in "Profile Strength" section; why?
	- Can't see everyone whose viewed your profile without Premium account (underlining goal to gain subscriptions)
	- What's the point of the Home Page being "here's what people have been up to?"
	- On the edit profile page, (I personally) keep accidentally clicking the edit background picture

Tasks for User Testing
	- Create a profile
	- update Profile Strength
	- make a post (maybe)
	- connect with someone from the Home Page
