centered towards whose looking @ your profile

"online resume" / professional identity

keep people coming back

more people use it than others (designer vs business / writers)

keep feed (news about businesses --> tied to Huffington post/NYTimes)

	have a twitter feed window (for business people)

	option to filter feed (people posts vs business news vs job listings)

personalized widgets - home page / feedback shows only things use cares about

shows recommendations
(keep option to see what other people see when they're on your page)

incorporate tabs to distinguish between similar content

don't force content

think about it more as a tool than a network

make it offer information that user can't get anywhere else

make big people who've seen your profile, job listings, etc

focusing on professional side
